handle authenticate: 

1)use AuthProvider to handle data in, but still use useReducer ???

2)The AuthProvider will check the token is real in useEffect, but when done just update the status in localStorage, redux store.
Not handle move to routes to project route, and handle it in auth component. Doesn't get it
